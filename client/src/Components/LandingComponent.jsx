         FMRI studies have shown that most adults with ADHD donâ€™t know how to express feelings. However, as people with ADHD tend to excel in thinking outside the box, art therapy has proven to create natural moments to express thoughts and feelings in an environment that is often less threatening than talk therapy.

        The OpenBCI Cyton headset analyzes your EEG (electroencephalogram) by measuring the electrical activity of the brain and infers your mood. The signals are then converted into audio and visual representations with the help of Google's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhanced Vertex AI Gemini Pro. To check out what your brain signals can generate, put on the headset and press start!
